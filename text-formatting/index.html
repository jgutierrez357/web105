    <h1>Casino</h1>

    <h2>Directed by Martin Scorsese</h2>
    <h3>Overview of the film</h3>

    <p>Casino is a film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is a masterpiece that was first released in 1995. It is an
        action packed film that keeps you on your toes and does not let you rest. Las Vegas is the main setting of the
        movie. It
        shows you the beauty and how it is a fun place that adults go to, to gamble, have drinks, and let loose. It also
        shows you the
        dark,
        horrific parts of Las Vegas. The scamming, the murdering, and all the evils of Las Vegas. The two main
        characters, Ace
        Rothstein and Nicky Santoro, are played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.</p>

    <p>The film begins with Ace Rothstein opening his car door, turning the key, and the car emitting into flames. It
        starts off with a literal bang. It makes you want to continue to watch it and see how that happened, or even why
        it
        happened.After that is all shown, it takes you back in time. Ace is narrating the film and wants you to
        understand the
        story.This is where you learn that he runs a casino. Nicky Santoro then begins to narrate. He explains how it
        went
        from being on top of the world, to losing it all. Nicky says “It turned out to be the last time that street guys
        like us
        were ever given anything that f***ing valuable again”. That is the beginning to you learning that they are tied
        to the
        mob.
    </p>


    <p>The movie has many twists and turns throughout the movie. Ace meets a woman named Ginger McKenna. She lurks
        around the casino and is the biggest hustler around. Ace and Ginger lay eyes on each other and had a connection.
        They meet
        in the casino and end up becoming married months later. Ace puts all his trust into a woman that he knows was
        slimy and
        is a scammer. In the end, their love was not true and many fights occurred. She became a drug addict and an
        alcoholic. She ended up stealing millions from Ace also. In between all of the relationship drama, there are
        many other
        problems that occur. While the casino is doing great, Nicky is creating headlines with his violent behavior
        behind the scenes.
        All of the behind the scenes distractions eventually lead to the federal government shutting it all down. Nicky
        ends up
        beaten to death with a baseball bat. At the end of the movie, it shows the same scene that was shown in the
        beginning.
        Ace’s car was blown up by dynamite put under his car. Luckily, he lives and leaves Las Vegas.</p>


    <p>The movie was a great film to me. It was my first time watching it, and it was very enjoyable. The acting was
        incredible. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci really play it off as mobsters. The film gave me an urge to go to Las
        Vegas and have some fun. The directing and mise en scene was great. The film was a hair under three hours long
        but it did
        not feel like it. The film flew by because of the non-stop attention getters and action packed scenes. This is a
        film I
        would definitely recommend to others and something that I will be watching again. It was my first film that
        included
        the mob in it. It makes me want to find others with similar plots.</p>
